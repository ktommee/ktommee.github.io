Hi, my name is Kristina Tommee.  I was born and raised here in Honolulu, Hawaii. I graduated from Hawaii Baptist Academy in 2017. I am currently a Junior at University of Hawaii at Manoa studying Accounting.


I don't know anything about programming, but I am very excited to see where this course takes me. I am a bit nervous since this course will be challenging, but I know that I will get a lot out of it!
