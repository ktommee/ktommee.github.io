I always found programming and coding interesting but never thought to actually taking the time to learn it. My high school offered a introductory programming class, but I was too focused on taking the typical classes that every other high schooler took such as Calculus, Psychology, and Chemistry. A few of my friends took the class and would always tell me about the new things they learned. It was from that point that I regretted not learning even the basics to programming. 


After graduating high school and moving into college, I always had my mind set on Accounting. As the years went by, I was focused more on taking classes that would fulfill my general education requirements and prerequisites to taking other Accounting classes. In Sophomore year, I came to the conclusion that doing a double major may be beneficial. I decided that was going to major in Accounting and Finance. 


At this point, my younger sister was a senior in high school, and she decided to take the introductory programming class. It was only then that I started to think about programming again. Just like my friends, my sister would tell me about the things that she learned in the class. Everything sounded so fascinating that I finally decided that I had to take a programming class myself and learn what it is all about.
